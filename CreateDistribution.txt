How to create a distribution of python-fmask. 

1. Ensure that you have pulled and committed everything which needs to go in.
2. Change the version number in the fmask/__init__.py. Version number
   is of the form a.b.c, as discussed below. 
   DON'T FORGET TO COMMIT THIS, BEFORE THE NEXT STEP!!!!
3. Update the release notes page in the doco (doc/source/releasenotes.rst), 
   by going through the change logs since the last release, and noting 
   what has been done. 
   COMMIT THIS CHANGE!!!
4. Use "git tag" to add a version number tag, e.g.
    git tag pythonfmask-0.3.1
5. Push the changes to github with "git push".
6. Check out a clean copy of the repository into /tmp or
   somewhere similar and 'cd' into it.
7. Create the distribution tarball, using
    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
   This creates both a tar.gz and a zip, under a subdirectory called dist
8. Go to the https://github.com/ubarsc/python-fmask/releases page, and create a 
   new release by pressing "Draft a new release". 
   You should fill in the following:
       Tag version: pythonfmask-A.B.C
       Release Title: Version A.B.C
       Upload files: Add the tar.gz and zip files. 
       Click "Publish release"


Version Numbers.
The python-fmask version number is structured as A.B.C. We follow the conventions 
outlined in Semantic Versioning [https://semver.org]
- The A number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The B number should change for introduction of significant new features
- The C number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes.
